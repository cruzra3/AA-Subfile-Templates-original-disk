                RPG/400 Interactive Template Technique
                      Installation instructions


Requirements:


 1.  You must be running PC Support/400 or Client Access/400 on your PC 
     and currently connected to the AS/400.  If you have multiple systems
     connected, this will install on the default system.


 2.  This installation process uses the following PC Support/400 functions
     to install the sample library:

       . Remote command (RMTCMD).
      
       . File transfer from PC in batch mode (RFROMPCB).

     You will need to know where these files are located.  They are 
     typically in C:\PCS if they were selected during the install
     process.  Otherwise, they would be located on your AS/400 product
     folders.



Automatic installation:

 1.  Insert the diskette into your diskette drive.

 2.  Switch to that drive:

        C:\> A:      <Enter>

 3.  Enter the following command:

        A:\> install <pcs_path>

          where <pcs_path> is the drive and path where your PC Support
          code is located.  For example:

                 install c:\pcs              (Remote command and File
                                              transfer are installed
                                              locally)
            - or - 
  
                 install i:\qiwsfl2          (Shared folders must be 
                                              active and drive I: assigned
                                              to all folders)
            - or -

                 install i:\qdls\qiwsfl2     (If running Client Access/400
                                              for Windows V3R1M0, this is
                                              where you will find your 
                                              Remote command and file
                                              transfer functions)

4.  This completes the automatic installation.  You now have a library on
    your AS/400 called TEMPLATE.




Manual installation:


 1.  Insert your diskette into your diskette drive.


 2.  Enter the following commands from the AS/400 command line:

       CRTLIB   CASEDUC TEXT('CAS Education Series Library') AUT(*ALL)
                  CRTAUT(*ALL)

       CRTSRCPF CASEDUC/EDUSRC

       ADDPFM   CASEDUC/EDUSRC   CVTPFSAV

       CRTPF    CASEDUC/RSSDTAF  RCDLEN(528)

       CRTSAVF  CASEDUC/RSSSAVF


 3.  Use your file transfer program to copy the following diskette files to
     the AS/400:

__COPY PASTE CVTPFSAV.REX IN CASEDUC/EDUSRC MBR(CVTPFSAV.REXX)
__COPY RSSDTAF.DAT to c:\RSSDTAF.DAT 
__Run CMD
__FTP '10.212.158.20'
__CD CASEDUC
__BIN
__Put c:\RSSDTAF.DAT RSSDTAF
__GOTO STEP 4 BELOW                         

     From diskette file:     To AS/400 file:                File type:
     -------------------     -----------------------------  ----------------

     CVTPFSAV.REX            CASEDUC/EDUSRC MBR(CVTPFSAV)  ASCII Source file

     RSSDTAF.DAT             CASEDUC/RSSDTAF               No conversion


     Note:  It is very important that you do not convert the RSSDTAF.DAT file
            when transferring to the AS/400.  This file is already in an
            AS/400 save-file format.


 4.  Now run the following commands from your AS/400 command line:

        STRREXPRC SRCMBR(CVTPFSAV) SRCFILE(CASEDUC/EDUSRC)

        RSTLIB TEMPLATE *SAVF SAVF(CASEDUC/RSSSAVF)

        DLTLIB CASEDUC


5.  This completes the manual installation.  You now have a library on your
    AS/400 called TEMPLATE.
